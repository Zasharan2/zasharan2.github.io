            <h1>Zasharan2</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Zasharan2, and I created this site to gather some of the things I have created in one place.</p>
            <p>I like mathematics, physics, coding, linguistics, and a whole bunch of other stuff.</p>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that I pronounce ln(x) as "lawn of x" /lɑn ʌv ɛks/.</p>
